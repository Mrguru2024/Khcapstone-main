Upcoming Features
These are features that will be added in the next phase of the project. They focus on core functionalities that have not yet been implemented or are under development.

1. VIN Lookup API Integration
   Description: Connect the system to an external API for VIN-to-keycode lookups, allowing real-time access to keycode data.
   Goals: Enhance the reliability of keycode requests by offering accurate VIN lookups via third-party services.
   Steps:
   Research available VIN APIs (e.g., NHTSA, Carfax).
   Implement API calls in the backend.
   Display data fetched from the API in the frontend.
2. Subscription Payment Integration
   Description: Allow users to subscribe to keycode lookup services through paid plans.
   Goals: Implement payment processing for recurring subscriptions using Stripe or PayPal.
   Steps:
   Set up payment gateway.
   Create subscription plans (monthly, yearly).
   Implement Stripe/PayPal integration for handling payments.
   Store subscription statuses in the database.
3. Admin Dashboard Enhancements
   Description: Extend the admin panel to provide more control over users, keycode requests, and subscriptions.
   Goals: Admins should be able to manage all aspects of the platform, including user suspensions, issuing refunds, and viewing request history.
   Steps:
   Add CRUD functionality for user management.
   Develop an interface to view all keycode requests and their statuses.
   Include subscription management features.
   User Experience Improvements
4. Responsive Design
   Description: Improve the UI design to ensure mobile responsiveness across all pages.
   Goals: Provide a smooth experience on mobile devices, ensuring elements scale properly on smaller screens.
   Steps:
   Test the application on various screen sizes.
   Implement responsive design strategies using TailwindCSS.
   Adjust layouts to ensure usability across devices.
5. User-Friendly Error Handling
   Description: Make error messages more user-friendly and informative.
   Goals: Help users understand what went wrong, with clear guidance on how to resolve issues.
   Steps:
   Customize error pages for 404, 500, and other common errors.
   Add validation messages for forms and improve feedback for failed submissions.
   Technical Enhancements
6. Caching for Keycode Requests
   Description: Cache frequently requested VIN-to-keycode lookups to improve response times.
   Goals: Speed up requests for frequently looked-up VINs by storing results in a cache (e.g., Redis).
   Steps:
   Implement Redis or in-memory caching.
   Set cache expiration times for keycode results.
7. Database Optimization
   Description: Optimize the MySQL database for better query performance, especially as the data grows.
   Goals: Ensure efficient data retrieval, especially for large sets of keycode requests and users.
   Steps:
   Implement indexing on key columns (e.g., VIN, user IDs).
   Optimize queries in repositories.
8. Code Refactoring
   Description: Clean up and refactor code for better maintainability and performance.
   Goals: Improve the readability and structure of the code, following best practices like SOLID principles.
   Steps:
   Refactor controllers and services to reduce duplication.
   Ensure separation of concerns in service and repository layers.
   Third-Party Integrations
9. OAuth Authentication
   Description: Allow users to sign in using Google or Facebook OAuth.
   Goals: Make it easier for users to log in by offering social sign-in options.
   Steps:
   Research OAuth strategies with Spring Security.
   Implement OAuth for Google and Facebook.
   Store OAuth tokens securely.
10. Notification Service
    Description: Set up email notifications to alert users of new keycodes or subscription changes.
    Goals: Keep users informed about their requests and account statuses.
    Steps:
    Integrate with an email provider like SendGrid or Mailgun.
    Send email alerts for successful keycode requests and subscription renewals.
    Security Enhancements
11. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
    Description: Implement two-factor authentication for added security during login.
    Goals: Protect user accounts by requiring a second form of authentication (SMS, Google Authenticator).
    Steps:
    Implement 2FA using Spring Security.
    Offer users the option to enable 2FA in their account settings.
12. Data Encryption
    Description: Encrypt sensitive data, such as VINs and keycodes, in the database.
    Goals: Ensure that sensitive information is stored securely.
    Steps:
    Use encryption libraries for storing sensitive data.
    Ensure that data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.
    Potential Challenges
13. Scalability
    Issue: Handling a growing number of users and keycode requests efficiently.
    Plan: Implement microservices architecture to decouple features and scale specific components as needed.
14. Handling Third-Party API Failures
    Issue: Dependency on external VIN lookup services may lead to downtime if the service becomes unavailable.
    Plan: Implement a retry mechanism or fallback strategy to handle failed API calls gracefully.
    Long-Term Vision
    While this phase of development focuses on the backend for Keycode Help, future iterations will focus on:

A polished and scalable frontend using React or Next.js.
Real-time VIN lookups using advanced caching and queuing techniques.
Implementing machine learning algorithms to predict keycode requests based on historical data.
Expanding the service to integrate with other automotive data services.
This document will be updated regularly as new ideas and plans emerge during development. Stay tuned!
